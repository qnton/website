# Personal Website - [qnt.one][1]

My name is Anton Werschinin and I am a fullstack developer and designer. On this website, you will find a selection of my work and a little bit about me.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the repository, make sure you have the following tools installed on your computer:

- Node.js: Next.js requires Node.js to run. You can download the latest version from the official website (https://nodejs.org/).
- Git: Git is a version control system that is used to manage the source code for the portfolio. You can download Git from the official website (https://git-scm.com/).

## Setting Up the Repository

To set up the repository for the portfolio, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository.
2. Clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/qnton/qnt.one.git
```

3. Change into the repository directory:

```
cd qnt.one
```

4. Install the dependencies using the following command:

```
npm install
```

> This will install all of the required packages and libraries needed to run the portfolio.

## Running the Portfolio

To start the portfolio, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

> This will start the development server and open the portfolio in your default web browser. You can now make changes to the code and see the results in real-time.
